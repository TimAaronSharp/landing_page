Navbar:
Make menu items stack vertically on smaller screens when space gets too cramped. Maybe do a slide in effect for the menu?


Hero:
Decide on what to put there (likely scrap the codetree and put something else there that has icons, maybe moving around?)
Maybe make the hero section the about me section, but without including everything in the about me section? Something just like,
"Hello, I'm Tim Sharp, Full-Stack Web Developer" and maybe a link/download link to my resume?


Skills section:
Make sure the toolbox has some indication that it should be clicked on (maybe for the about me pic as well?).
Scrap making each skill logo grow when you hover over it instead just add a progress bar that appears under each skill logo that shows 
how proficient you are in that skill with a slight delayed effect, appearing after they have come to rest (or maybe just before?).


Expand on portfolio section:
Add/change links to be a live site link and a link to github repo.
Make project images larger to showcase what you have made.
Give more information on the project (ie. describe the project a bit?). Maybe have this come up in an overlay on top of the image
when hovering over the image?
